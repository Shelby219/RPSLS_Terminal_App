## Status Update #1

My terminal app is an idea my husband gave me, to create Rock Paper Scissors as a terminal app format. I decided to use the 5 weapon expanded version, make popular on the Big Bang Theory called Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard. Doing this I thought the game would appeal to a broad audience, especially users that appreciated Star Trek and the Big Bang Theory pop culture. It also allows for the chances of tieing to decrease, as there are 5 choices for weapons. I still wanted tieing to be an aspect of this game, as when played in real life the game has tieing allowed.

To initiate my assessment I began physically drawing some rough draft control-flow diagrams. I then moved to an application called Smart Draw to do some more detailed diagrams.

I began writing up the table for move manual test cases.
